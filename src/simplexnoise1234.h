		\brief Declares the SimplexNoise1234 class for producing Perlin simplex noise.
		\author Stefan Gustavson (stegu@itn.liu.se)

/*
 * This is a clean, fast, modern and free Perlin Simplex noise class in C++.
 * Being a stand-alone class with no external dependencies, it is
 * highly reusable without source code modifications.
 *
 *
 * Note:
 * Replacing the "float" type with "double" can actually make this run faster
 * on some platforms. A templatized version of SimplexNoise1234 could be useful.

/*
 * Back ported to C by IceDragon200 (github.com/IceDragon200)
 *   Seriously, why the hell was this in C++
